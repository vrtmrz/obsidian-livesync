# Settings of Self-Hosted LiveSync

There are many settings in self-hosted LiveSync. This document describes each setting in detail (not how-to). Configuration and settings are divided into several categories and indicated by icons. The icon is as follows:

## 1. Setup

This pane is used for setting up self-hosted LiveSync. There are several options to set up self-hosted LiveSync.

### 1. Quick Setup

The preferred method for setting up self-hosted LiveSync with only a few clicks.

#### Connect with Setup URI

Setup self-hosted LiveSync with the `setup URI` which is [copied from another device](#copy-current-settings-as-a-new-setup-uri) or the setup script.

#### Manual setup

Step-by-step setup for self-hosted LiveSync. You can setup self-hosted LiveSync manually with Minimal setting items.

#### Enable LiveSync

This button only appears when the setup was not completed. If you have completed the setup manually, you can enable LiveSync on this device with this button.

### 2. To setup other devices

#### Copy the current settings to a Setup URI

You can copy the current settings to a new setup URI, which can be used to setup other devices: [Use the copied setup URI](#use-the-copied-setup-uri).

### 3. Reset

#### Discard existing settings and databases

Reset the self-hosted LiveSync settings and databases.
**Dangerous operation. Please be careful when using this.**

### 4. Enable extra and advanced features

To keep the setup simple, some panes are hidden by default. You can enable them here.

#### Enable advanced features

Setting key: useAdvancedMode

The following panes will be shown when you enable this setting:
| Icon | Description |

## 3. Remote Configuration

### 1. Remote Server

#### Remote Server Type

Setting key: remoteType

### 2. Notifications

MB (0 to disable) - Notify on launch when the estimated remote storage size exceeds this value.

### 3. Privacy & Encryption

#### End-to-End Encryption

Setting key: encrypt

Enable end-to-end encryption. Enabling this is recommended. If you change the passphrase, you need to rebuild the database (you will be prompted beforehand).

#### Passphrase

Setting key: passphrase

Encryption passphrase. If you change the passphrase, you need to rebuild the database (you will be prompted beforehand).

#### Path Obfuscation

Setting key: usePathObfuscation

By default, file paths are not obfuscated to improve performance. If you enable this, file paths will be obfuscated, allowing you to hide the path of files.

#### Use dynamic iteration count (Experimental)

Setting key: useDynamicIterationCount

This is an experimental feature and not recommended. If you enable this, the iteration count of the encryption will be determined dynamically. This is useful when you want to improve the performance.
