# Quick setup

[Japanese docs](./quick_setup_ja.md) - [Chinese docs](./quick_setup_cn.md).

The plugin has so many configuration options to deal with different circumstances. However, only a few settings are required in the normal cases. Therefore, `The Setup wizard` has been implemented to simplify the setup.

![](../images/quick_setup_1.png)

There are three methods to set up Self-Hosted LiveSync.

1. [Using setup URIs](#1-using-setup-uris) *(Recommended)*
2. [Minimal setup](#2-minimal-setup)
3. [Full manually setup the and Enable on this dialogue](#3-manually-setup)

## At the first device

### 1. Using setup URIs

> [!TIP]
> What is the setup URI? Why is it required?  
> The setup URI is the encrypted representation of Self-Hosted LiveSync configuration as a URI. This starts `obsidian://setuplivesync?settings=`. This is encrypted with a passphrase, so that it can be shared relatively securely between devices. It is a bit long, but it is one line. This allows a series of settings to be set at once without any inconsistencies. 
> 
> If you have configured the remote database by [Automated setup on Fly.io](./setup_flyio.md#a-very-automated-setup) or [set up your server with the tool](./setup_own_server.md#1-generate-the-setup-uri-on-a-desktop-device-or-server), **you should have one of them** 

In this procedure, [this video](https://youtu.be/7sa_I1832Xc?t=146) may help us.

1. Click `Use` button (Or launch `Use the copied setup URI` from Command palette).
2. Paste the Setup URI into the dialogue
3. Type the passphrase of the Setup URI
4. Answer `yes` for `Importing LiveSync's conf, OK?`.
5. Answer `Set it up as secondary or subsequent device` for `How would you like to set it up?`.
6. Initialisation will begin, please hold a while.
7. You will asked about the hidden file synchronisation, answer as you like.
   1. If you are new to Self-Hosted LiveSync, we can configure it later so leave it once.
8. Synchronisation has been started! `Reload app without saving` is recommended after the indicators of Self-Hosted LiveSync disappear.

OK, we can proceed the [next step](#).

### 2. Minimal setup

If you do not have any setup URI, Press the `start` button. The setting dialogue turns into the wizard mode and will display only minimal items.

>[!TIP]
> We can generate the setup URI with the tool in any time. Please use [this tool](./setup_own_server.md#1-generate-the-setup-uri-on-a-desktop-device-or-server).

#### Select the remote type

1. Select the Remote Type from dropdown list.
We now have a choice between CouchDB (and its compatibles) and object storage (MinIO, S3, R2). CouchDB is the first choice and is also recommended. And supporting Object Storage is an experimental feature.

#### Remote configuration 

##### CouchDB

Enter the information for the database we have set up.

![](../images/quick_setup_3.png)  

##### Object Storage

1. Enter the information for the S3 API and bucket.

![](../images/quick_setup_3b.png)  

Note 1: if you use S3, you can leave the Endpoint URL empty.
Note 2: if your Object Storage cannot configure the CORS setting fully, you may able to connect to the server by enabling the `Use Custom HTTP Handler` toggle.

2. Press `Test` of `Test Connection` once and ensure you can connect to the Object Storage.

#### Only CouchDB: Test database connection and Check database configuration

We can check the connectivity to the database, and the database settings.

![](../images/quick_setup_5.png)  

#### Only CouchDB: Check and Fix database configuration

Check the database settings and fix any problems on the spot.

![](../images/quick_setup_6.png)

This item may vary depending on the connection. In the above case, press all three Fix buttons.  
If the Fix buttons disappear and all become check marks, we are done.

#### Confidentiality configuration (Optional but very preferred)

![](../images/quick_setup_4.png)

Enable End-to-end encryption and the contents of your notes will be encrypted at the moment it leaves the device. We strongly recommend enabling it. And `Path Obfuscation` also obfuscates filenames. Now stable and recommended.

These setting can be disabled if you are inside a closed network and it is clear that you will not be accessed by third parties.

> [!TIP]
> Encryption is based on 256-bit AES-GCM.  

We should proceed to the Next step.

#### Sync Settings
Finally, finish the wizard by selecting a preset for synchronisation.

Note: If you are going to use Object Storage, you cannot select `LiveSync`.

![](../images/quick_setup_9_1.png)

Select any synchronisation methods we want to use and `Apply`. If database initialisation is required, it will be performed at this time. When `All done!` is displayed, we are ready to synchronise.

The dialogue of `Copy settings as a new setup URI` will be open automatically. Please input a passphrase to encrypt the new `Setup URI`. (This passphrase is to encrypt the setup URI, not the vault).

![](../images/quick_setup_10.png)

The Setup URI will be copied to the clipboard, please make a note(Not in Obsidian) of this.

>[!TIP]
We can copy this in any time by `Copy current settings as a new setup URI`.

### 3. Manually setup

It is strongly recommended to perform a "minimal set-up" first and set up the other contents after making sure has been synchronised.

However, if you have some specific reasons to configure it manually, please click the `Enable` button of `Enable LiveSync on this device as the set-up was completed manually`.
And, please copy the setup URI by `Copy current settings as a new setup URI` and make a note(Not in Obsidian) of this.

## At the subsequent device
After installing Self-Hosted LiveSync on the first device, we should have a setup URI. **The first choice is to use it**. Please share it with the device you want to setup.

It is completely same as [Using setup URIs on the first device](#1-using-setup-uris). Please refer it.
