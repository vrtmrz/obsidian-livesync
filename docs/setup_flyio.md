# Setup CouchDB on fly.io

This is how to configure fly.io and CouchDB on it for Self-Hosted LiveSync.

> [!WARNING]
> It is **your** instance. In Obsidian, we have files locally. Hence, do not hesitate to destroy the remote database if you feel something have got weird. We can launch and switch to the new CouchDB instance anytime[^1].
> 
[^1]: Actually, I am always building the database for reproduction of the issue like so.

> [!NOTE] 
> **What and why is the Fly.io?**  
> At some point, we started to experience problems related to our IBM Cloudant account. At the same time, Self-Hosted LiveSync started to improve its functionality, requiring CouchDB in a more natural state to use all its features.
>
> Then we found Fly.io. Fly.io is the PaaS Platform, which can be useable for a very reasonable price. It generally falls within the `Free Allowances` range in most cases.

## Required materials

- A valid credit or debit card.

## Setup CouchDB instance

### A. Very automated setup

[![LiveSync Setup onto Fly.io SpeedRun 2024 using Google Colab](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7sa_I1832Xc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sa_I1832Xc)

1. Open [setup-flyio-on-the-fly-v2.ipynb](../setup-flyio-on-the-fly-v2.ipynb).
2. Press the `Open in Colab` button.
3. Choose a region and run all blocks (Refer to video).
   1. If you do not have the account yet, the sign-up page will be shown, please follow the instructions. The [Official document is here](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/sign-up/).
4. Copy the Setup-URI and Use it in the Obsidian.
5. You have been synchronised. Use the Setup-URI in subsequent devices.

Steps 4 and 5 are detailed in the [Quick Setup](./quick_setup.md#1-using-setup-uris).

> [!NOTE]
> Your automatically configured configurations will be shown on the result in the Colab note like below, and **it will not be saved**. Please make a note of it somewhere.
> ```
> -- YOUR CONFIGURATION --
> URL     : https://billowing-dawn-6619.fly.dev
> username: billowing-cherry-22580
> password: misty-dew-13571
> region  : nrt
> ```

### B. Scripted Setup

Please refer to the document of [deploy-server.sh](../utils/readme.md#deploy-serversh).

### C. Manual Setup

| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| campanella       | Username                    | It is less likely to fail if it consists only of letters and numbers.    |
| dfusiuada9suy    | Password                    |                                                                          |
| nrt              | Region to make the instance | We can use any [region](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/) near us. |

#### 1. Install flyctl

- Mac or Linux

```sh
$ curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
```

- Windows

```powershell
$ iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

#### 2. Sign up or Sign in to fly.io

- Sign up

```bash
$ fly auth signup
```

- Sign in

```bash
$ fly auth login
```

For more information, please refer to [Sign up](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/sign-up/) and [Sign in](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/sign-in/).

#### 3. Make a configuration file

1. Make `fly.toml` from template `fly.template.toml`.  
   We can simply copy and rename the file. The template is on [utils/flyio/fly.template.toml](../utils/flyio/fly.template.toml)
2. Decide the instance name, initialize the App, and set credentials.

>[!TIP]
> - The name `billowing-dawn-6619` is randomly decided name, and it will be a part of the CouchDB URL. It should be globally unique. Therefore, it is recommended to use something random for this name.
> - Explicit naming is very good for humans. However, we do not often get the chance to actually enter this manually (have designed so). This database may contain important information for you. The needle should be hidden in the haystack.


```bash
$ fly launch --name=billowing-dawn-6619 --env="COUCHDB_USER=campanella" --copy-config=true --detach --no-deploy --region nrt --yes
$ fly secrets set COUCHDB_PASSWORD=dfusiuada9suy
```

#### 4. Deploy

```
$ flyctl deploy

#### 5. Apply CouchDB configuration

After the initial setup, CouchDB needs some more customisations to be used from Self-Hosted LiveSync. It can be configured in browsers or by HTTP-REST APIs.

This section is set up using the REST API.

1. Prepare environment variables.

- Mac or Linux:

```bash
export couchHost=https://billowing-dawn-6619.fly.dev
export couchUser=campanella
export couchPwd=dfusiuada9suy
```

- Windows

```powershell
set couchHost https://billowing-dawn-6619.fly.dev
set couchUser campanella
set couchPwd dfusiuada9suy
$creds = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"))
```

2. Perform cluster setup

- Mac or Linux

```bash
curl -X POST "${couchHost}/_cluster_setup" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"action\":\"enable_single_node\",\"username\":\"${couchUser}\",\"password\":\"${couchPwd}\",\"bind_address\":\"0.0.0.0\",\"port\":5984,\"singlenode\":true}"  --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
```

- Windows

```powershell
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'POST' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds } "${couchHost}/_cluster_setup" -Body "{""action"":""enable_single_node"",""username"":""${couchUser}"",""password"":""${couchPwd}"",""bind_address"":""0.0.0.0"",""port"":5984,""singlenode"":true}"
```

Note: if the response code is not 200. We have to retry the request once again.
If you run the request several times and it does not result in 200, something is wrong. Please report it.

3. Configure parameters

- Mac or Linux

```bash
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd/require_valid_user" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"true"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd_auth/require_valid_user" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"true"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/httpd/WWW-Authenticate" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"Basic realm=\"couchdb\""' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/httpd/enable_cors" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"true"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd/enable_cors" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"true"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd/max_http_request_size" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"4294967296"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/couchdb/max_document_size" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"50000000"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/cors/credentials" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"true"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
curl -X PUT "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/cors/origins" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,http://localhost"' --user "${couchUser}:${couchPwd}"
```

- Windows

```powershell
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd/require_valid_user" -Body  '"true"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd_auth/require_valid_user" -Body  '"true"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/httpd/WWW-Authenticate" -Body  '"Basic realm=\"couchdb\""'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/httpd/enable_cors" -Body  '"true"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd/enable_cors" -Body  '"true"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/chttpd/max_http_request_size" -Body  '"4294967296"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/couchdb/max_document_size" -Body  '"50000000"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/cors/credentials" -Body  '"true"'
iwr -UseBasicParsing -Method 'PUT' -ContentType 'application/json; charset=utf-8' -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Basic ' + $creds }  "${couchHost}/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/cors/origins" -Body  '"app://obsidian.md,capacitor://localhost,http://localhost"'
```

Note: Each of these should also be repeated until finished in 200.

#### 6. Use it from Self-Hosted LiveSync

Now the CouchDB is ready to use from Self-Hosted LiveSync. We can use `https://billowing-dawn-6619.fly.dev` in URI, `campanella` in `Username` and `dfusiuada9suy` in `Password` on Self-Hosted LiveSync. The `Database name` could be anything you want.
Please refer to the [Minimal Setup of the Quick Setup](./quick_setup.md#2-minimal-setup).

## Delete the Instance

If you want to delete the CouchDB instance, you can do that in [fly.io Dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard/personal)

If you have done with [B. Scripted Setup](#b-scripted-setup), we can use [delete-server.sh](../utils/readme.md#delete-serversh).
