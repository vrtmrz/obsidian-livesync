# Utilities
Here are some useful things.

## couchdb

### couchdb-init.sh
This script can configure CouchDB with the necessary settings by REST APIs.

#### Materials
- Mandatory: curl

#### Usage

```sh
export hostname=http://localhost:5984/
export username=couchdb-admin-username
export password=couchdb-admin-password
./couchdb-init.sh
```

curl result will be shown, however, all of them can be ignored if the script has been run completely.

## fly.io

### deploy-server.sh

A fully automated CouchDB deployment script. We can deploy CouchDB onto fly.io. The only we need is an account of it.

All omitted configurations will be determined at random. (And, it is preferred). The region is configured to `nrt`.
If Japan is not close to you, please choose a region closer to you. However, the deployed database will work if you leave it at all.

#### Materials
- Mandatory: curl, flyctl
- Recommended: deno

#### Usage
```sh
#export appname=
#export username=
#export password=
#export database=
#export passphrase=
export region=nrt #pick your nearest location
./deploy-server.sh
```

The result of this command is as follows.

All we have to do is copy the setup-URI (`obsidian`://...`) and open it from Self-Hosted LiveSync on Obsidian.

If you did not install Deno, configurations will be printed again, instead of the setup-URI. In this case, we should configure it manually.

### delete-server.sh

The pair script of `deploy-server.sh`. We can delete the deployed server by this with fly.toml.

#### Materials

- Mandatory: flyctl, jq
- Recommended: none

#### Usage
