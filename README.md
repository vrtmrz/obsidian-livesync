# Self-hosted LiveSync
[Japanese docs](./README_ja.md) - [Chinese docs](./README_cn.md).

Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB or Object Storage (e.g., MinIO, S3, R2, etc.) as the server.

![obsidian_live_sync_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45774780/137355323-f57a8b09-abf2-4501-836c-8cb7d2ff24a3.gif)

Note: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official "Obsidian Sync".

## Features

- Synchronize vaults very efficiently with less traffic.
- Good at conflicted modification.
  - Automatic merging for simple conflicts.
- Using OSS solution for the server.
  - Compatible solutions can be used.
- Supporting End-to-end encryption.
- Synchronisation of settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins, via [Customization sync(Beta)](#customization-sync) or [Hidden File Sync](#hiddenfilesync)
- WebClip from [obsidian-livesync-webclip](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-livesync-webclip/jfpaflmpckblieefkegjncjoceapakdf)

This plug-in might be useful for researchers, engineers, and developers with a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. Or just anyone who would like the peace of mind of knowing that their notes are fully private.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back your vault up.
> - Do not enable this plugin with another synchronization solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).
> - This is a synchronization plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this for backup.
