# Self-hosted LiveSync
[Japanese docs](./README_ja.md) - [Chinese docs](./README_cn.md).

Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB or Object Storage (e.g., MinIO, S3, R2, etc.) as the server.

![obsidian_live_sync_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45774780/137355323-f57a8b09-abf2-4501-836c-8cb7d2ff24a3.gif)

Note: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official "Obsidian Sync".

## Features

- Synchronize vaults very efficiently with less traffic.
- Good at conflicted modification.
  - Automatic merging for simple conflicts.
- Using OSS solution for the server.
  - Compatible solutions can be used.
- Supporting End-to-end encryption.
- Synchronisation of settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins, via [Customization sync(Beta)](#customization-sync) or [Hidden File Sync](#hiddenfilesync)
- WebClip from [obsidian-livesync-webclip](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-livesync-webclip/jfpaflmpckblieefkegjncjoceapakdf)
- WebRTC peer-to-peer synchronisation without the need for any `host` is now possible. (Experimental)
  - This feature is still in the experimental stage. Please be careful when using it. 
  - Instead of using public servers, you can use [webpeer](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-commonlib/tree/main/apps/webpeer) the pseudo client for receiving and sending between devices.
    - A pre-built instance is served at [fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/webpeer](https://fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/webpeer/) (in the vrtmrz blog site). This is of course also peer-to-peer. Feel free to use it.
  - There is an [English explanatory article](https://fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/blog/0034-p2p-sync-en.html), and [Japanese explanatory article](https://fancy-syncing.vrtmrz.net/blog/0034-p2p-sync).

This plug-in might be useful for researchers, engineers, and developers with a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. Or just anyone who would like the peace of mind of knowing that their notes are fully private.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> - Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back your vault up.
> - Do not enable this plugin with another synchronization solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).
> - This is a synchronization plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this for backup.

## How to use

### 3-minute setup - CouchDB on fly.io

**Recommended for beginners**

[![LiveSync Setup onto Fly.io SpeedRun 2024 using Google Colab](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7sa_I1832Xc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sa_I1832Xc)

1. [Setup CouchDB on fly.io](docs/setup_flyio.md)
2. Configure plug-in in [Quick Setup](docs/quick_setup.md)

### Manually Setup

1. Setup the server
   1. [Setup CouchDB on fly.io](docs/setup_flyio.md)
   2. [Setup your CouchDB](docs/setup_own_server.md)
2. Configure plug-in in [Quick Setup](docs/quick_setup.md)

> Now, fly.io has become not free. Fortunately, even though there are some issues, we are still able to use IBM Cloudant. Here is [Setup IBM Cloudant](docs/setup_cloudant.md). It will be updated soon!

> You can use [HuggingFace](docs/setup_easy_huggingface.md) too, which is free and does not require a credit card, but keep in mind that its storage is ephemeral unless you pay (Shouldn't be a problem anyway, see [#442](issues/442) )
