# 0.25

Since 19th July, 2025 (beta1 in 0.25.0-beta1, 13th July, 2025)

After reading Issue #668, I conducted another self-review of the E2EE-related code. In retrospect, it was clearly written by someone inexperienced, which is understandable, but it is still rather embarrassing. Three years is certainly enough time for growth.

I have now rewritten the E2EE code to be more robust and easier to understand. It is significantly more readable and should be easier to maintain in the future. The performance issue, previously considered a concern, has been addressed by introducing a master key and deriving keys using HKDF. This approach is both fast and robust, and it provides protection against rainbow table attacks. (In addition, this implementation has been [a dedicated package on the npm registry](https://github.com/vrtmrz/octagonal-wheels), and tested in 100% branch-coverage).

As a result, this is the first time in a while that forward compatibility has been broken. We have also taken the opportunity to change all metadata to use encryption rather than obfuscation. Furthermore, the `Dynamic Iteration Count` setting is now redundant and has been moved to the `Patches` pane in the settings. Thanks to Rabin-Karp, the eden setting is also no longer necessary and has been relocated accordingly. Therefore, v0.25.0 represents a legitimate and correct evolution.

## 0.25.20

26th September, 2025

### Fixed

- Chunk fetching no longer reports errors when the fetched chunk could not be saved (#710).
    - Just using the fetched chunk temporarily.
- Chunk fetching reports errors when the fetched chunk is surely corrupted (#710, #712).
- It no longer detects files that the plug-in has modified.
    - It may reduce unnecessary file comparisons and unexpected file states.

### Improved

- Now checking the remote database configuration respecting the CouchDB version (#714).

## 0.25.19

18th September, 2025

### Improved

- Now encoding/decoding for chunk data and encryption/decryption are performed in native functions (if they were available).
    - This uses Uint8Array.fromBase64 and Uint8Array.toBase64, which are natively available in iOS 18.2+ and Android with Chrome 140+.
        - In Android, WebView is by default updated with Chrome, so it should be available in most cases.
    - Note that this is not available in Desktop yet (due to being based on Electron). We are staying tuned for future updates.
    - This realised by an external(?) package [octagonal-wheels](https://github.com/vrtmrz/octagonal-wheels). Therefore, this update only updates the dependency.

## 0.25.18

17th September, 2025

### Fixed

- Property encryption detection now works correctly (On Self-hosted LiveSync, it was not broken, but as a library, it was not working correctly).
- Initialising the chunk splitter is now surely performed.
- DirectFileManipulator now works fine (as a library)
    - Old `DirectFileManipulatorV1` is now removed.

### Refactored

- Removed some unnecessary intermediate files.

## 0.25.17

16th September, 2025

### Fixed

- No longer information-level logs have produced during toggling `Show only notifications` in the settings (#708).
- Ignoring filters for Hidden file sync now works correctly (#709).

### Refactored

- Removed some unnecessary intermediate files.

## 0.25.16

4th September, 2025

### Improved

- Improved connectivity for P2P connections
- The connection to the signalling server can now be disconnected while in the background or when explicitly disconnected.
    - These features use a patch that has not been incorporated upstream.
    - This patch is available at [vrtmrz/trystero](https://github.com/vrtmrz/trystero).

## 0.25.15

3rd September, 2025

### Improved

- Now we can configure `forcePathStyle` for bucket synchronisation (#707).

## 0.25.14

2nd September, 2025

### Fixed

- Opening IndexedDB handling has been ensured.
- Migration check of corrupted files detection has been fixed.
    - Now informs us about conflicted files as non-recoverable, but noted so.
    - No longer errors on not-found files.

## 0.25.13

1st September, 2025

### Fixed

- Conflict resolving dialogue now properly displays the changeset name instead of A or B (#691).

## 0.25.12

29th August, 2025

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue with automatic synchronisation starting (#702).

## 0.25.11

28th August, 2025

### Fixed

- Automatic translation detection on the first launch now works correctly (#630).
- No errors are shown during synchronisations in offline (if not explicitly requested) (#699).
- Missing some checking during automatic-synchronisation now works correctly.

## 0.25.10

26th August, 2025

### New experimental feature

- We can perform Garbage Collection (Beta2) without rebuilding the entire database, and also fetch the database.
    - Note that this feature is very experimental and should be used with caution.
    - This feature requires disabling `Fetch chunks on demand`.

### Fixed

- Resetting the bucket now properly clears all uploaded files.

### Refactored

- Some files have been moved to better reflect their purpose and improve maintainability.
- The extensive LiveSyncLocalDB has been split into separate files for each role.

### Fixed

- Unexpected `Failed to obtain PBKDF2 salt` or similar errors during bucket-synchronisation no longer occur.
- Unexpected long delays for chunk-missing documents when using bucket-synchronisation have been resolved.
- Fetched remote chunks are now properly stored in the local database if `Fetch chunks on demand` is enabled.
- The 'fetch' dialogue's message has been refined.
- No longer overwriting any corrupted documents to the storage on boot-sequence.

### Refactored

- Type errors have been corrected.

## 0.25.9

20th August, 2025

### Fixed

- CORS Checking messages now use replacements.
- Configuring CORS setting via the UI now respects the existing rules.
- Now startup-checking works correctly again, performs migration check serially and then it will also fix starting LiveSync or start-up sync. (#696)
- Statusline in editor now supported 'Bases'.

## 0.25.8

18th August, 2025

### New feature

- Insecure chunk detection has been implemented.
    - A notification dialogue will be shown if any insecure chunks are detected; these may have been created by v0.25.6 due to its issue. If this dialogue appears, please ensure you rebuild the database after backing it up.

## 0.25.7

15th August, 2025

**Since the release of 0.25.6, there are two large problem. Please update immediately.**

- We may have corrupted some documents during the migration process. **Please check your documents on the wizard.**
- Due to a chunk ID assignment issue, some data has not been encrypted. **Please rebuild the database using Rebuild Everything** if you have enabled E2EE.

**_So, If you have enabled E2EE, please perform `Rebuild everything`. If not, please check your documents on the wizard._**

In next version, insecure chunk detection will be implemented.

### Fixed

- Off-loaded chunking have been fixed to ensure proper functionality (#693).
- Chunk document ID assignment has been fixed.
- Replication prevention message during version up detection has been improved (#686).
- `Keep A` and `Keep B` on Conflict resolving dialogue has been renamed to `Use Base` and `Use Conflicted` (#691).

### Improved

- Metadata and content-size unmatched documents are now detected and reported, prevented to be applied to the storage.
    - This behaviour can be configured in `Patch` -> `Edge case addressing (Behaviour)` -> `Process files even if seems to be corrupted`
    - Note: this toggle is for the direct-database-manipulation users.

### New Features

- `Scan for Broken files` has been implemented on `Hatch` -> `TroubleShooting`.

### Refactored

- Off-loaded processes have been refactored for the better maintainability.
    - Files prefixed `bg.worker` are now work on the worker threads.
    - Files prefixed `bgWorker.` are now also controls these worker threads. (I know what you want to say... I will rename them).
- Removed unused code.

## ~~0.25.5~~ 0.25.6

(0.25.5 has been withdrawn due to a bug in the `Fetch chunks on demand` feature).

9th August, 2025

### Fixed

- Storage scanning no longer occurs when `Suspend file watching` is enabled (including boot-sequence).
    - This change improves safety when troubleshooting or fetching the remote database.
- `Fetch chunks on demand` is now working again (if you installed 0.25.5, other versions are not affected).

### Improved

- Saving notes and files now consumes less memory.
    - Data is no longer fully buffered in memory and written at once; instead, it is now written in each over-2MB increments.
- Chunk caching is now more efficient.
    - Chunks are now managed solely by their count (still maintained as LRU). If memory usage becomes excessive, they will be automatically released by the system-runtime.
    - Reverse-indexing is also no longer used. It is performed as scanning caches and act also as a WeakRef thinning.
- Both of them (may) are effective for #692, #680, and some more.

### Changed

- `Incubate Chunks in Document` (also known as `Eden`) is now fully sunset.
    - Existing chunks can still be read, but new ones will no longer be created.
- The `Compute revisions for chunks` setting has also been removed.
    - This feature is now always enabled and is no longer configurable (restoring the original behaviour).
- As mentioned, `Memory cache size (by total characters)` has been removed.
    - The `Memory cache size (by total items)` setting is now the only option available (but it has 10x ratio compared to the previous version).

### Refactored

- A significant refactoring of the core codebase is underway.
    - This is part of our ongoing efforts to improve code maintainability, readability, and to unify interfaces.
        - Previously, complex files posed a risk due to a low bus factor. Fortunately, as our devices have become faster and more capable, we can now write code that is clearer and more maintainable (And not so much costs on performance).
    - Hashing functions have been refactored into the `HashManager` class and its derived classes.
    - Chunk splitting functions have been refactored into the `ContentSplitterCore` class and its derived classes.
    - Change tracking functions have been refactored into the `ChangeManager` class.
    - Chunk read/write functions have been refactored into the `ChunkManager` class.
    - Fetching chunks on demand is now handled separately from the `ChunkManager` and chunk reading functions. Chunks are queued by the `ChunkManager` and then processed by the `ChunkFetcher`, simplifying the process and reducing unnecessary complexity.
    - Then, local database access via `LiveSyncLocalDB` has been refactored to use the new classes.
- References to external sources from `commonlib` have been corrected.
- Type definitions in `types.ts` have been refined.
- Unit tests are being added incrementally.
    - I am using `Deno` for testing, to simplify testing and coverage reporting.
    - While this is not identical to the Obsidian environment, `jest` may also have limitations. It is certainly better than having no tests.
        - In other words, recent manual scenario testing has highlighted some shortcomings.
    - `pouchdb-test`, used for testing PouchDB with Deno, has been added, utilising the `memory` adapter.

Side note: Although class-oriented programming is sometimes considered an outdated style, However, I have come to re-evaluate it as valuable from the perspectives of maintainability and readability.

## 0.25.4

29th July, 2025

### Fixed

- The PBKDF2Salt is no longer corrupted when attempting replication while the device is offline. (#686)
    - If this issue has already occurred, please use `Maintenance` -> `Rebuilding Operations (Remote Only)` -> `Overwrite Remote` and `Send` to resolve it.
    - Please perform this operation on the device that is most reliable.
    - I am so sorry for the inconvenience; there are no patching workarounds. The rebuilding operation is the only solution.
        - This issue only affects the encryption of the remote database and does not impact the local databases on any devices.
        - (Preventing synchronisation is by design and expected behaviour, even if it is sometimes inconvenient. This is also why we should avoid using workarounds; it is, admittedly, an excuse).
        - In any case, we can unlock the remote from the warning dialogue on receiving devices. We are performing replication, instead of simple synchronisation at the expense of a little complexity (I would love to express thank you again for your every effort to manage and maintain the settings! Your all understanding saves our notes).
    - This process may require considerable time and bandwidth (as usual), so please wait patiently and ensure a stable network connection.

### Side note

The PBKDF2Salt will be referred to as the `Security Seed`, and it is used to derive the encryption key for replication. Therefore, it should be stored on the server prior to synchronisation. We apologise for the lack of explanation in previous updates!

## 0.25.3

22nd July, 2025

### Fixed

- Now the `Doctor` at migration will save the configuration.

## 0.25.2 ~~0.25.1~~

(0.25.1 was missed due to a mistake in the versioning process).
19th July, 2025

### Refined and New Features

- Fetching the remote database on `RedFlag` now also retrieves remote configurations optionally.
    - This is beneficial if we have already set up another device and wish to use the same configuration. We will see a much less frequent `Unmatched` dialogue.
- The setup wizard using Set-up URI and QR code has been improved.
    - The message is now more user-friendly.
    - The obsolete method (manual setting application) has been removed.
    - The `Cancel` button has been added to the setup wizard.
    - We can now fetch the remote configuration from the server if it exists, which is useful for adding new devices.
        - Mostly same as a `RedFlag` fetching remote configuration.
    - We can also use the `Doctor` to check and fix the imported (and fetched) configuration before applying it.

### Changes

- The Set-up URI is now encrypted with a new encryption algorithm (mostly the same as `V2`).
    - The new Set-up URI is not compatible with version 0.24.x or earlier.

## 0.25.0

### Fixed

- The encryption algorithm now uses HKDF with a master key.
    - This is more robust and faster than the previous implementation.
    - It is now more secure against rainbow table attacks.
    - The previous implementation can still be used via `Patches` -> `End-to-end encryption algorithm` -> `Force V1`.
        - Note that `V1: Legacy` can decrypt V2, but produces V1 output.
- `Fetch everything from the remote` now works correctly.
    - It no longer creates local database entries before synchronisation.
- Extra log messages during QR code decoding have been removed.

### Changed

- The following settings have been moved to the `Patches` pane:
    - `Remote Database Tweak`
        - `Incubate Chunks in Document`
        - `Data Compression`

### Behavioural and API Changes

- `DirectFileManipulatorV2` now requires new settings (as you may already know, E2EEAlgorithm).
- The database version has been increased to `12` from `10`.
    - If an older version is detected, we will be notified and synchronisation will be paused until the update is acknowledged. (It has been a long time since this behaviour was last encountered; we always err on the side of caution, even if it is less convenient.)

### Refactored

- `couchdb_utils.ts` has been separated into several explicitly named files.
- Some missing functions in `bgWorker.mock.ts` have been added.

## 0.24.0

I know that we have been waiting for a long time. It is finally released!

Over the past three years since the inception of the plugin, various features have been implemented to address diverse user needs. This is truly honourable, and I am grateful for your years of support. However, this process has led to an increasingly disorganised codebase, with features becoming entangled. Consequently, this has led to a situation where bugs can go unnoticed and resolving one issue may inadvertently introduce another.

In 0.24.0, I reorganised the previously jumbled main codebase into clearly defined modules. Although I had assumed that the total size of the code would not increase, I discovered that it has in fact increased. While the complexity is still considerable, the refactoring has improved the clarity of the code's structure. Additionally, while testing the release candidates, we still found many bugs to fix, which helped to make this plug-in robust and stable. Therefore, we are now ready to use the updated plug-in, and in addition to that, proceed to the next step.

This is also the first step towards a fully-fledged-fancy LiveSync, not just a plug-in from Obsidian. Of course, it will still be a plug-in primarily and foremost, but this development marks a significant step towards the self-hosting concept.

Finally, I would like to once again express my respect and gratitude to all of you. My gratitude extends to all of the dev testers! Your contributions have certainly made the plug-in robust and stable!

Thank you, and I hope your troubles will be resolved!

10th July, 2025

### Fixed

- The description of `Enable Developers' Debug Tools.` has been refined.
    - Now performance impact is more clearly stated.
- Automatic conflict checking and resolution has been improved.
    - It now works parallelly for each other file, instead of sequentially. It makes significantly faster on first synchronisation when with local files information.
- Resolving conflicts dialogue will not be shown for the multiple files at once.
    - It will be shown for each file, one by one.

## 0.24.30

9th July, 2025

    - The Rabin-Karp algorithm is used for efficient chunking.
    - This will be the default in the new installations.
    - It is more robust and faster than the previous one.
    - We can change it in the `Advanced` pane of the settings.
- New language `ko` (Korean) has been added.
    - Thank you for your contribution, [@ellixspace](https://x.com/ellixspace)!

### Improved

- All translations have been rewritten into YAML format, to easier to manage and contribute.
    - We can write them with comments, newlines, and other YAML features.
- Doctor recommendations are now shown in a user-friendly notation.
    - We can now see the recommended as `V3: Fine deduplication` instead of `v3-rabin-karp`.

### Refactored

20th June, 2025

### Fixed

- Synchronisation with buckets now works correctly, regardless of whether a prefix is set or the bucket has been (re-) initialised (#664).
- An information message is now displayed again, during any automatic synchronisation is enabled (#662).

### Tidied up

### Fixed

- Batch Update is no longer available in LiveSync mode to avoid unexpected behaviour. (#653)
- Now compatible with Cloudflare R2 again for bucket synchronisation.
    - @edo-bari-ikutsu, thank you for [your contribution](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-commonlib/pull/12)!
- Prevention of broken behaviour due to database connection failures added (#649).

## 0.24.27

10th June, 2025

### Improved

- We can use prefix for path for the Bucket synchronisation.
    - For example, if you set the `vaultName/` as a prefix for the bucket in the root directory, all data will be transferred to the bucket under the `vaultName/` directory.
- The "Use Request API to avoid `inevitable` CORS problem" option is now promoted to the normal setting, not a niche patch.

### Fixed

- Now switching replicators applied immediately, without the need to restart Obsidian.

### Tidied up

- Some dependencies have been updated to the latest version.

## 0.24.26

14th May, 2025

This update introduces an option to circumvent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) constraints for CouchDB requests, by leveraging Obsidian's native request
API. The implementation of such a feature had previously been deferred due to
significant security considerations.

CORS is a vital security mechanism, enabling servers like CouchDB -- which
functions as a sophisticated REST API -- to control access from different
origins, thereby ensuring secure communication across trust boundaries. I had
long hesitated to offer a CORS circumvention method, as it deviates from
security best practices; My preference was for users to configure CORS correctly
on the server-side.

However, this policy has shifted due to specific reports of intractable
CORS-related configuration issues, particularly within enterprise proxy
environments where proxy servers can unpredictably alter or block
communications. Given that a primary objective of the "Self-hosted LiveSync"
plugin is to facilitate secure Obsidian usage within stringent corporate
settings, addressing these 'unavoidable' user-reported problems became
essential. Mostly raison d'être of this plugin.

Consequently, the option "Use Request API to avoid `inevitable` CORS problem"
has been implemented. Users are strongly advised to enable this _only_ when
operating within a trusted environment. We can enable this option in the `Patch` pane.

However, just to whisper, this is tremendously fast.

### New Features

- Automatic display-language changing according to the Obsidian language
  setting.
    - We will be asked on the migration or first startup.
    - **Note: Please revert to the default language if you report any issues.**
    - Not all messages are translated yet. We welcome your contribution!
- Now we can limit files to be synchronised even in the hidden files.
- "Use Request API to avoid `inevitable` CORS problem" has been implemented.
    - Less secure, please use it only if you are sure that you are in the trusted
      environment and be able to ignore the CORS. No `Web viewer` or similar tools
      are recommended. (To avoid the origin forged attack). If you are able to
      configure the server setting, always that is recommended.
- `Show status icon instead of file warnings banner` has been implemented.
    - If enabled, the ⛔ icon will be shown inside the status instead of the file
      warnings banner. No details will be shown.

### Improved

- All regular expressions can be inverted by prefixing `!!` now.

### Fixed

- No longer unexpected files will be gathered during hidden file sync.
- No longer broken `\n` and new-line characters during the bucket
  synchronisation.
- We can purge the remote bucket again if we using MinIO instead of AWS S3 or
  Cloudflare R2.
- Purging the remote bucket is now more reliable.
    - 100 files are purged at a time.
- Some wrong messages have been fixed.

### Behaviour changed

- Entering into the deeper directories to gather the hidden files is now limited
  by `/` or `\/` prefixed ignore filters. (It means that directories are scanned
  deeper than before).
    - However, inside the these directories, the files are still limited by the
      ignore filters.

### Etcetera

- Some code has been tidied up.
- Trying less warning-suppressing and be more safer-coding.
- Dependent libraries have been updated to the latest version.
- Some build processes have been separated to `pre` and `post` processes.

## 0.24.25

22nd April, 2025

### Improved

- Peer-to-peer synchronisation has been got more robust.

### Fixed

- No longer broken falsy values in settings during set-up by the QR code
  generation.

### Refactored

- Some `window` references now have pointed to `globalThis`.
- Some sloppy-import has been fixed.
- A server side implementation `Synchromesh` has been suffixed with `deno`
  instead of `server` now.

## 0.24.24

15th April, 2025

### Fixed

- No longer broken JSON files including `\n`, during the bucket synchronisation.
  (#623)
- Custom headers and JWT tokens are now correctly sent to the server during
  configuration checking. (#624)

### Improved

- Bucket synchronisation has been enhanced for better performance and
  reliability.
    - Now less duplicated chunks are sent to the server. Note: If you have
      encountered about too less chunks, please let me know. However, you can send
      it to the server by `Overwrite remote`.
    - Fetching conflicted files from the server is now more reliable.
    - Dependent libraries have been updated to the latest version.
        - Also, let me know if you have encountered any issues with this update.
          Especially you are using a device that has been in use for a little
          longer.

## 0.24.23

10th April, 2025

### New Feature

- Now, we can send custom headers to the server.
    - They can be sent to either CouchDB or Object Storage.
- Authentication with JWT in CouchDB is now supported.
    - I will describe steps later, but please refer to the
      [CouchDB document](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/auth.html#authentication-configuration).
    - A JWT keypair for testing can be generated in the setting dialogue.

### Improved

- The QR Code for set-up can be shown also from the setting dialogue now.
- Conflict checking for preventing unexpected overwriting on the boot-up process
  has been quite faster.

### Fixed

- Some bugs on Dev and Testing modules have been fixed.

## 0.24.22 ~~0.24.21~~

1st April, 2025

(Really sorry for the confusion. I have got a miss at releasing...).

### Fixed

- No longer conflicted files are handled in the boot-up process. No more
  unexpected overwriting.
    - It ignores `Always overwrite with a newer file`, and always be prevented for
      the safety. Please pick it manually or open the file.
- Some log messages on conflict resolution has been corrected.
- Automatic merge notifications, displayed on the grounds of `same`, have been
  degraded to logs.

### Improved

- Now we can fetch the remote database with keeping local files completely
  intact.
    - In new option, all files are stored into the local database before the
      fetching, and will be merged automatically or detected as conflicts.
- The dialogue presenting options when performing `Fetch` are now more
  informative.

### Refactored

- Some class methods have been fixed its arguments to be more consistent.
- Types have been defined for some conditional results.

## 0.24.20

24th March, 2025

### Improved

- Now we can see the detail of `TypeError` using Obsidian API during remote
  database access.

### Behaviour and default changed

- **NOW INDEED AND ACTUALLY** `Compute revisions for chunks` are backed into
  enabled again. it is necessary for garbage collection of chunks.
    - As far as existing users are concerned, this will not automatically change,
      but the Doctor will inform us.

## 0.24.19

5th March, 2025

### New Feature

- Now we can generate a QR Code for transferring the configuration to another device.
    - This QR Code can be scanned by the camera app or something QR Code Reader of another device, and via Obsidian URL, the configuration will be transferred.
    - Note: This QR Code is not encrypted. So, please be careful when transferring the configuration.

## 0.24.18

28th February, 2025

### Fixed

- Now no chunk creation errors will be raised after switching `Compute revisions for chunks`.
- Some invisible file can be handled correctly (e.g., `writing-goals-history.csv`).
- Fetching configuration from the server is now saves the configuration immediately (if we are not in the wizard).

### Improved

- Mismatched configuration dialogue is now more informative, and rewritten to more user-friendly.
- Applying configuration mismatch is now without rebuilding (at our own risks).
- Now, rebuilding is decided more fine grained.

### Improved internally

- Translations can be nested. i.e., task:`Some procedure`, check: `%{task} checking`, checkfailed: `%{check} failed` produces `Some procedure checking failed`.
    - Max to 10 levels of nesting

## 0.24.17

27th February, 2025

Confession. I got the default values wrong. So scary and sorry.

## 0.24.16

### Improved

#### Peer-to-Peer

- Now peer-to-peer synchronisation checks the settings are compatible with each other.
    - No longer unexpected database broken, phew.
- Peer-to-peer synchronisation now handles the platform and detects pseudo-clients.
    - Pseudo clients will not decrypt/encrypt anything, just relay the data. Hence, always settings are not compatible. Therefore, we have to accept the incompatibility for pseudo clients.

#### General

- New migration method has been implemented, that called `Doctor`.

    - `Doctor` checks the difference between the ideal and actual values and encourages corrective action. To facilitate our decision, the reasons for this and the recommendations are also presented.
    - This can be used not only during migration. We can invoke the doctor from the settings for trouble-shooting.

- The minimum interval for replication to be caused when an event occurs can now be configurable.
- Some detail note has been added and change nuance about the `Report` in the setting dialogue, which had less informative.

### Behaviour and default changed

- `Compute revisions for chunks` are backed into enabled again. it is necessary for garbage collection of chunks.
    - As far as existing users are concerned, this will not automatically change, but the Doctor will inform us.

### Refactored

- Platform specific codes are more separated. No longer `node` modules were used in the browser and Obsidian.

## 0.24.15

### Fixed

- Now, even without WeakRef, Polyfill is used and the whole thing works without error. However, if you can switch WebView Engine, it is recommended to switch to a WebView Engine that supports WeakRef.

## 0.24.14

### Fixed

- Resolving conflicts of JSON files (and sensibly merging them) is now working fine, again!
    - And, failure logs are more informative.
- More robust to release the event listeners on unwatching the local database.

### Refactored

- JSON file conflict resolution dialogue has been rewritten into svelte v5.
- Upgrade eslint.
- Remove unnecessary pragma comments for eslint.

## 0.24.13

Sorry for the lack of replies. The ones that were not good are popping up, so I am just going to go ahead and get this one... However, they realised that refactoring and restructuring is about clarifying the problem. Your patience and understanding is much appreciated.

### Fixed

#### General Replication

- No longer unexpected errors occur when the replication is stopped during for some reason (e.g., network disconnection).

#### Peer-to-Peer Synchronisation

- Set-up process will not receive data from unexpected sources.
- No longer resource leaks while enabling the `broadcasting changes`
- Logs are less verbose.
- Received data is now correctly dispatched to other devices.
- `Timeout` error now more informative.
- No longer timeout error occurs for reporting the progress to other devices.
- Decision dialogues for the same thing are not shown multiply at the same time anymore.
- Disconnection of the peer-to-peer synchronisation is now more robust and less error-prone.

#### Webpeer

- Now we can toggle Peers' configuration.

### Refactored

- Cross-platform compatibility layer has been improved.
- Common events are moved to the common library.
- Displaying replication status of the peer-to-peer synchronisation is separated from the main-log-logic.
- Some file names have been changed to be more consistent.

## 0.24.12

I created a SPA called [webpeer](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-commonlib/tree/main/apps/webpeer) (well, right... I will think of a name again), which replaces the server when using Peer-to-Peer synchronisation. This is a pseudo-client that appears to other devices as if it were one of the clients. . As with the client, it receives and sends data without storing it as a file.
And, this is just a single web page, without any server-side code. It is a static web page that can be hosted on any static web server, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. All you have to do is to open the page and enter several items, and leave it open.

### Fixed

- No longer unnecessary acknowledgements are sent when starting peer-to-peer synchronisation.

### Refactored

- Platform impedance-matching-layer has been improved.
    - And you can see the actual usage of this on [webpeer](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-commonlib/tree/main/apps/webpeer) that a pseudo client for peer-to-peer synchronisation.
- Some UIs have been got isomorphic among Obsidian and web applications (for `webpeer`).

## 0.24.11

Peer-to-peer synchronisation has been implemented!

Until now, I have not provided a synchronisation server. More people may not
even know that I have shut down the test server. I confess that this is a bit
repetitive, but I confess it is a cautionary tale. This is out of a sense of
self-discipline that someone has occurred who could see your data. Even if the
'someone' is me. I should not be unaware of its superiority, even though
well-meaning and am a servant of all. (Half joking, but also serious). However,
now I can provide you with a signalling server. Because, to the best of my
knowledge, it is only the network that is connected to your device. Also, this
signalling server is just a Nostr relay, not my implementation. You can run your
implementation, which you consider trustworthy, on a trustworthy server. You do
not even have to trust me. Mate, it is great, isn't it? For your information,
strfry is running on my signalling server.

Nevertheless, that being said, to be more honest, I still have not decided what
to do with this signalling server if too much traffic comes in.

Note: Already you have noticed this, but let me mention it again, this is a
significantly large update. If you have noticed anything, please let me know. I
will try to fix it as soon as possible (Some address is on my
[profile](https://github.com/vrtmrz)).

### Improved

- New Translation: `es` (Spanish) by @zeedif (Thank you so much)!
- Now all of messages can be selectable and copyable, also on the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. Now we can copy or share the messages easily.

### New Feature

- Peer-to-Peer Synchronisation has been implemented!
    - This feature is still in early beta, and it is recommended to use it with caution.
    - However, it is a significant step towards the self-hosting concept. It is now possible to synchronise your data without using any remote database or storage. It is a direct connection between your devices.
    - Note: We should keep the device online to synchronise the data. It is not a background synchronisation. Also it needs a signalling server to establish the connection. But, the signalling server is used only for establishing the connection, and it does not store any data.

### Fixed

- No longer memory or resource leaks when the plug-in is disabled.
- Now deleted chunks are correctly detected on conflict resolution, and we are guided to resurrect them.
- Hanging issue during the initial synchronisation has been fixed.
- Some unnecessary logs have been removed.
- Now all modal dialogues are correctly closed when the plug-in is disabled.

### Refactor

- Several interfaces have been moved to the separated library.
- Translations have been moved to each language file, and during the build, they are merged into one file.
- Non-mobile friendly code has been removed and replaced with the safer code.
    - (Now a days, mostly server-side engine can use webcrypto, so it will be rewritten in the future more).
- Started writing Platform impedance-matching-layer.
- Svelte has been updated to v5.
- Some function have got more robust type definitions.
- Terser optimisation has slightly improved.
- During the build, analysis meta-file of the bundled codes will be generated.

## 0.24.10

### Fixed

- Fixed the issue which the filename is shown as `undefined`.
- Fixed the issue where files transferred at short intervals were not reflected.

### Improved

- Add more translations: `ja-JP` (Japanese) by @kohki-shikata (Thank you so much)!

### Internal

- Some files have been prettified.

## 0.24.9

Skipped.

## 0.24.8

### Fixed

- Some parallel-processing tasks are now performed more safely.
- Some error messages has been fixed.

### Improved

- Synchronisation is now more efficient and faster.
- Saving chunks is a bit more robust.

### New Feature

- We can remove orphaned chunks again, now!
    - Without rebuilding the database!
    - Note: Please synchronise devices completely before removing orphaned chunks.
    - Note2: Deleted files are using chunks, if you want to remove them, please commit the deletion first. (`Commit File Deletion`)
    - Note3: If you lost some chunks, do not worry. They will be resurrected if not so much time has passed. Try `Resurrect deleted chunks`.
    - Note4: This feature is still beta. Please report any issues you encounter.
    - Note5: Please disable `On demand chunk fetching`, and enable `Compute revisions for each chunk` before using this feature.
        - These settings is going to be default in the future.

## 0.24.7

### Fixed (Security)

- Assigning IDs to chunks has been corrected for more safety.
    - Before version 0.24.6, there were possibilities in End-to-End encryption where a brute-force attack could be carried out against an E2EE passphrase via a chunk ID if a zero-byte file was present. Now the chunk ID should be assigned more safely, and not all of passphrases are used for generating the chunk ID.
    - This is a security fix, and it is recommended to update and rebuild database to this version as soon as possible.
    - Note: It keeps the compatibility with the previous versions, but the chunk ID will be changed for the new files and modified files. Hence, deduplication will not work for the files which are modified after the update. It is recommended to rebuild the database to avoid the potential issues, and reduce the database size.
    - Note2: This fix is only for with E2EE. Plain synchronisation is not affected by this issue.

### Fixed

- Now the conflict resolving dialogue is automatically closed after the conflict has been resolved (and transferred from other devices; or written by some other resolution).
- Resolving conflicts by timestamp is now working correctly.
    - It also fixes customisation sync.

### Improved

- Notifications can be suppressed for the hidden files update now.
- No longer uses the old-xxhash and sha1 for generating the chunk ID. Chunk ID is now generated with the new algorithm (Pure JavaScript hash implementation; which is using Murmur3Hash and FNV-1a now used).

## 0.24.6

### Fixed (Quick Fix)

- Fixed the issue of log is not displayed on the log pane if the pane has not been shown on startup.
    - This release is only for it. However, fixing this had been necessary to report any other issues.

## 0.24.5

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect behaviour when comparing objects with undefined as a property value.

### Improved

- The status line and the log summary are now displayed more smoothly and efficiently.
    - This improvement has also been applied to the logs displayed in the log pane.

## 0.24.4

### Fixed

- Fixed so many inefficient and buggy modules inherited from the past.

### Improved

- Tasks are now executed in an efficient asynchronous library.
- On-demand chunk fetching is now more efficient and keeps the interval between requests.
    - This will reduce the load on the server and the network.
    - And, safe for the Cloudant.

## 0.24.3

### Improved

- Many messages have been improved for better understanding as thanks to the fine works of @Volkor3-16! Thank you so much!
- Documentations also have been updated to reflect the changes in the messages.
- Now the style of In-Editor Status has been solid for some Android devices.

## 0.24.2

### Rewritten

- Hidden File Sync is now respects the file changes on the storage. Not simply comparing modified times.
    - This makes hidden file sync more robust and reliable.

### Fixed

- `Scan hidden files before replication` is now configurable again.
- Some unexpected errors are now handled more gracefully.
- Meaningless event passing during boot sequence is now prevented.
- Error handling for non-existing files has been fixed.
- Hidden files will not be batched to avoid the potential error.
    - This behaviour had been causing the error in the previous versions in specific situations.
- The log which checking automatic conflict resolution is now in verbose level.
- Replication log (skipping non-targetting files) shows the correct information.
- The dialogue that asking enabling optional feature during `Rebuild Everything` now prevents to show the `overwrite` option.
    - The rebuilding device is the first, meaningless.
- Files with different modified time but identical content are no longer processed repeatedly.
- Some unexpected errors which caused after terminating plug-in are now avoided.
-

### Improved

- JSON files are now more transferred efficiently.
    - Now the JSON files are transferred in more fine chunks, which makes the transfer more efficient.

## 0.24.1

### Fixed

- Vault History can show the correct information of match-or-not for each file and database even if it is a binary file.
- `Sync settings via markdown` is now hidden during the setup wizard.
- Verify and Fix will ignore the hidden files if the hidden file sync is disabled.

#### New feature

- Now we can fetch the tweaks from the remote database while the setting dialogue and wizard are processing.

### Improved

- More things are moved to the modules.
    - Includes the Main codebase. Now `main.ts` is almost stub.
- EventHub is now more robust and typesafe.

## 0.24.0

### Improved

- The welcome message is now more simple to encourage the use of the Setup-URI.
    - The secondary message is also simpler to guide users to Minimal Setup.
        - But Setup-URI will be recommended again, due to its importance.
    - These dialogues contain a link to the documentation which can be clicked.
- The minimal setup is more minimal now. And, the setup is more user-friendly.
    - Now the Configuration of the remote database is checked more robustly, but we can ignore the warning and proceed with the setup.
- Before we are asked about each feature, we are asked if we want to use optional features in the first place.
    - This is to prevent the user from being overwhelmed by the features.
    - And made it clear that it is not recommended for new users.
- Many messages have been improved for better understanding.
    - Ridiculous messages have been (carefully) refined.
    - Dialogues are more informative and friendly.
        - A lot of messages have been mostly rewritten, leveraging Markdown.
        - Especially auto-closing dialogues are now explicitly labelled: `To stop the countdown, tap anywhere on the dialogue`.
- Now if the is plugin configured to ignore some events, we will get a chance to fix it, in addition to the warning.
    - And why that has happened is also explained in the dialogue.
- A note relating to device names has been added to Customisation Sync on the setting dialogue.
- We can verify and resolve also the hidden files now.

### Fixed

- We can resolve the conflict of the JSON file correctly now.
- Verifying files between the local database and storage is now working correctly.
- While restarting the plug-in, the shown dialogues will be automatically closed to avoid unexpected behaviour.
- Replicated documents that the local device has configured to ignore are now correctly ignored.
- The chunks of the document on the local device during the first transfer will be created correctly.
    - And why we should create them is now explained in the dialogue.
- If optional features have been enabled in the wizard, `Enable advanced features` will be toggled correctly.
  The hidden file sync is now working correctly. - Now the deletion of hidden files is correctly synchronised.
- Customisation Sync is now working correctly together with hidden file sync.
- No longer database suffix is stored in the setting sharing markdown.
- A fair number of bugs have been fixed.

### Changed

- Some default settings have been changed for an easier new user experience.
    - Preventing the meaningless migration of the settings.

### Tiding

- The codebase has been reorganised into clearly defined modules.
- Commented-out codes have been gradually removed.

### 0.23.0

Incredibly new features!

Now, we can use object storage (MinIO, S3, R2 or anything you like) for synchronising! Moreover, despite that, we can use all the features as if we were using CouchDB.
Note: As this is a pretty experimental feature, hence we have some limitations.

- This is built on the append-only architecture. It will not shrink used storage if we do not perform a rebuild.
- A bit fragile. However, our version x.yy.0 is always so.
- When the first synchronisation, the entire history to date is transferred. For this reason, it is preferable to do this under the WiFi network.
- Do not worry, from the second synchronisation, we always transfer only differences.

I hope this feature empowers users to maintain independence and self-host their data, offering an alternative for those who prefer to manage their own storage solutions and avoid being stuck on the right side of a sudden change in business model.

Of course, I use Self-hosted MinIO for testing and recommend this. It is for the same reason as using CouchDB. -- open, controllable, auditable and indeed already audited by numerous eyes.

Let me write one more acknowledgement.

I have a lot of respect for that plugin, even though it is sometimes treated as if it is a competitor, remotely-save. I think it is a great architecture that embodies a different approach to my approach of recreating history. This time, with all due respect, I have used some of its code as a reference.
Hooray for open source, and generous licences, and the sharing of knowledge by experts.

        - Now we can perform remote database compaction from the `Maintenance` pane.
    - Fixed:
        - We can detect the bucket could not be reachable.
    - Note:
        - Known inexplicable behaviour: Recently, (Maybe while enabling `Incubate chunks in Document` and `Fetch chunks on demand` or some more toggles), our customisation sync data is sometimes corrupted. It will be addressed by the next release.
- 0.23.4
    - Fixed:
        - No longer experimental configuration is shown on the Minimal Setup.

            - When we enabled this toggle, newly created chunks are temporarily kept within the document, and graduated to become independent chunks once stabilised.
            - The [design document](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/blob/3925052f9290b3579e45a4b716b3679c833d8ca0/docs/design_docs_of_keep_newborn_chunks.md) has been also available..
- 0.23.3
    - Fixed: No longer unwanted `\f` in journal sync.

    - New feature:
        - Now we can use Object Storage.

### 0.22.0

A few years passed since Self-hosted LiveSync was born, and our codebase had been very complicated. This could be patient now, but it should be a tremendous hurt.
Therefore at v0.22.0, for future maintainability, I refined task scheduling logic totally.

Of course, I think this would be our suffering in some cases. However, I would love to ask you for your cooperation and contribution.

Sorry for being absent so much long. And thank you for your patience!

Note: we got a very performance improvement.
Note at 0.22.2: **Now, to rescue mobile devices, Maximum file size is set to 50 by default**. Please configure the limit as you need. If you do not want to limit the sizes, set zero manually, please.

### 0.21.0

The E2EE encryption V2 format has been reverted. That was probably the cause of the glitch.
Instead, to maintain efficiency, files are treated with Blob until just before saving. Along with this, the old-fashioned encryption format has also been discontinued.
There are both forward and backwards compatibilities, with recent versions. However, unfortunately, we lost compatibility with filesystem-livesync or some.
It will be addressed soon. Please be patient if you are using filesystem-livesync with E2EE.

        - WARNING: Since this version, the compatibilities with older Filesystem LiveSync have been lost.

## 0.20.0

At 0.20.0, Self-hosted LiveSync has changed the binary file format and encrypting format, for efficient synchronisation.  
The dialogue will be shown and asks us to decide whether to keep v1 or use v2. Once we have enabled v2, all subsequent edits will be saved in v2. Therefore, devices running 0.19 or below cannot understand this and they might say that decryption error. Please update all devices.  
Then we will have an impressive performance.

Of course, these are very impactful changes. If you have any questions or troubled things, please feel free to open an issue and mention me.

Note: if you want to roll it back to v1, please enable `Use binary and encryption version 1` on the `Hatch` pane and perform the `rebuild everything` once.

Extra but notable information:

This format change gives us the ability to detect some `marks` in the binary files as same as text files. Therefore, we can split binary files and some specific sort of them (i.e., PDF files) at the specific character. It means that editing the middle of files could be detected with marks.

Now only a few chunks are transferred, even if we add a comment to the PDF or put new files into the ZIP archives.

- 0.20.7
    - Fixed
        - To better replication, path obfuscation is now deterministic even if with E2EE.

### 0.19.0

#### Customization sync

Since `Plugin and their settings` have been broken, so I tried to fix it, not just fix it, but fix it the way it should be.

Now, we have `Customization sync`.

It is a real shame that the compatibility between these features has been broken. However, this new feature is surely useful and I believe that worth getting over the pain.
We can use the new feature with the same configuration. Only the menu on the command palette has been changed. The dialog can be opened by `Show customization sync dialog`.

I hope you will give it a try.

### 0.18.0

#### Now, paths of files in the database can now be obfuscated. (Experimental Feature)

At before v0.18.0, Self-hosted LiveSync used the path of files, to detect and resolve conflicts. In naive. The ID of the document stored in the CouchDB was naturally the filename.
However, it means a sort of lacking confidentiality. If the credentials of the database have been leaked, the attacker (or an innocent bystander) can read the path of files. So we could not use confidential things in the filename in some environments.
Since v0.18.0, they can be obfuscated. so it is no longer possible to decipher the path from the ID. Instead of that, it costs a bit CPU load than before, and the data structure has been changed a bit.

We can configure the `Path Obfuscation` in the `Remote database configuration` pane.  
Note: **When changing this configuration, we need to rebuild both of the local and the remote databases**.

#### Minors

            - Be sure to fully all devices synchronised before perform it.
            - After cleaning up the remote, all devices will be locked out. If we are sure had it be synchronised, we can perform only cleaning-up locally. If not, we have to perform `Fetch`.
